# V1 Legacy - Baseline Implementation

## Overview

V1 represents the original baseline implementation of the health economic evaluation comparing psychedelic therapies against ECT for treatment-resistant depression.

## Key Features

### Analysis Capabilities
- Basic cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA)
- Simple probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA)
- Deterministic one-way sensitivity analysis
- Basic CEAC curves
- Net monetary benefit calculations

### Therapies Covered
- ECT (Standard Electroconvulsive Therapy)
- IV-KA (Intravenous Ketamine)
- Usual Care

### Geographic Coverage
- Australia (AU) - primary focus

### Economic Perspectives
- Health System perspective

## Outputs

### Figures
- Basic CE planes
- Simple CEAC curves
- Basic cost-effectiveness visualizations

### Tables
- Deterministic CEA results
- Basic PSA summaries
- Simple incremental analysis

## Purpose and Role

V1 established the foundational framework and provided baseline validation for the health economic model. It demonstrated proof-of-concept for comparing psychedelic therapies with ECT and established the basic model structure.

## Relationship to V4

V4 builds upon V1's foundation by:
- Expanding therapy coverage from 3 to 10 treatment strategies
- Adding comprehensive analysis capabilities
- Incorporating equity analysis
- Providing publication-ready outputs
- Maintaining V1's validated baseline results for comparison

## Historical Context

V1 was developed as the initial implementation and served as the baseline for all subsequent versions. While superseded by V2, V3, and V4, it remains important for understanding the project's evolution and validating that enhancements maintain consistency with original findings.
