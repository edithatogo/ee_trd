### Slide 8: Base-Case Results - Australia
**Cost-Effectiveness Results**

| Intervention | Total Cost (AUD) | QALYs | ICER vs ECT |
|-------------|------------------|-------|-------------|
| ECT | $59,200 | 7.13 | - |
| IV Ketamine | $69,200 | 6.78 | $28,500 |
| Esketamine | $83,200 | 6.56 | $156,000 |
| Psilocybin | $87,000 | 6.66 | $42,300 |

**Key Findings**
- ECT remains cost-effective benchmark
- Ketamine shows promise as alternative
- Esketamine not cost-effective at current prices

### Slide 9: Base-Case Results - New Zealand
**Cost-Effectiveness Results**

| Intervention | Total Cost (NZD) | QALYs | ICER vs ECT |
|-------------|------------------|-------|-------------|
| ECT | $53,600 | 7.13 | - |
| IV Ketamine | $62,920 | 6.78 | $26,800 |
| Esketamine | $73,120 | 6.56 | $142,000 |
| Psilocybin | $79,800 | 6.66 | $39,500 |

**Key Findings**
- Similar qualitative results to Australia
- Slightly lower ICERs due to different cost structures
- ECT dominant in both countries

### Slide 10: Uncertainty Analysis
**Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis**
- 2,000 iterations
- Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves

**Key Results**
- ECT: 50% probability cost-effective
- Ketamine: 45% probability cost-effective
- Esketamine: 0% probability cost-effective
- Psilocybin: 35% probability cost-effective

**Deterministic Sensitivity Analysis**
- Tornado diagrams showing key drivers
- ECT remission rate most influential
- Cost parameters moderate impact

### Slide 11: Scenario Analysis
**Scenario Results**

| Scenario | ICER (AU) | ICER (NZ) | Key Insight |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Base case | $28,500 | $26,800 | ECT dominant |
| Optimistic | $15,200 | $14,300 | Ketamine competitive |
| Pessimistic | $45,600 | $42,100 | ECT strongly dominant |

**Sensitivity to Assumptions**
- Efficacy assumptions drive results
- Cost reductions improve cost-effectiveness
- Durability of effect critical

### Slide 12: Subgroup Analysis
**Age Subgroups**
- Younger patients (<35): Poorer cost-effectiveness
- Older patients (65+): Better cost-effectiveness
- Middle age optimal balance

**Severity Subgroups**
- Severe depression: Ketamine cost-effective
- Moderate depression: ECT preferred
- Mild depression: Both less effective

**Gender Differences**
- Similar results across genders
- Slight variations in NMB
