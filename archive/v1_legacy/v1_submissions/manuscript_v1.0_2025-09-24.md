[See separate title_page_template.md]

## Abstract (250-300 words)

**Background**: Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) affects 20-30% of patients with major depressive disorder and represents a significant economic burden. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remains the gold standard but declining utilization has prompted interest in psychedelic therapies. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of intravenous ketamine, intranasal esketamine, and psilocybin-assisted therapy compared to ECT in Australia and New Zealand.

**Methods**: A Markov state-transition model simulated TRD progression over 10 years from healthcare system perspectives. Clinical parameters were derived from randomized trials and meta-analyses. Cost data included Medicare Benefits Schedule fees, Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme pricing, and hospital costs. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (2,000 iterations) assessed uncertainty. Budget impact and value of information analyses were conducted.

**Results**: ECT was the most cost-effective intervention in base-case analysis. Ketamine showed ICERs of AUD $28,500/QALY (Australia) and NZD $26,800/QALY (New Zealand). Esketamine was not cost-effective at current prices (ICER AUD $156,000/QALY). Psilocybin had intermediate cost-effectiveness (ICER AUD $42,300/QALY). Probabilistic analysis showed 45% probability of ketamine cost-effectiveness in Australia and 50% in New Zealand at standard thresholds. ECT remission rate was the primary driver of results. Five-year budget impact showed modest savings with psychedelic adoption.

**Conclusions**: ECT remains cost-effective for TRD, but ketamine offers a viable alternative for non-psychotic cases. Implementation requires careful patient selection and monitoring. The findings support gradual integration of psychedelic therapies alongside ECT, with priority for further clinical research to reduce uncertainty.

### Introduction

#### Background and Rationale

Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) represents a significant and growing challenge for mental health systems worldwide, affecting approximately 20-30% of patients with major depressive disorder who fail to respond adequately to at least two adequate trials of antidepressant medication [1][2]. In Australia and New Zealand, TRD contributes substantially to the burden of disease, with estimates suggesting that up to 100,000 Australians and 20,000 New Zealanders may experience TRD at any given time [3][4]. The condition is associated with profound functional impairment, increased risk of suicide, and substantial healthcare costs, making effective treatment interventions a critical priority for health systems.

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has long been considered the gold standard intervention for severe TRD, particularly when accompanied by psychotic features, catatonia, or high suicide risk [5]. ECT involves the induction of controlled seizures under anesthesia, typically administered 2-3 times per week for 6-12 sessions. While ECT demonstrates robust efficacy, with response rates of 60-80% in TRD populations, its use has declined in recent decades due to concerns about cognitive side effects, anesthesia risks, and patient stigma [6][7]. In Australia, ECT utilization rates have fallen from approximately 5.6 per 10,000 population in the early 2000s to around 2.8 per 10,000 in recent years, while New Zealand rates remain similarly low at approximately 2.0 per 10,000 [8][9].

The limitations of conventional pharmacotherapy and ECT have spurred interest in novel therapeutic approaches, with psychedelic-assisted therapies emerging as a promising alternative. Ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic originally developed in the 1960s, has demonstrated rapid and robust antidepressant effects when administered intravenously or intranasally as esketamine [10]. More recently, classical psychedelics such as psilocybin have shown transformative potential in treating depression, particularly when combined with psychological support [11]. These therapies offer several theoretical advantages over ECT, including potentially fewer cognitive side effects, outpatient administration, and more acceptable treatment experiences for patients.

#### Current Evidence Base

Clinical evidence supporting psychedelic therapies has grown substantially in recent years. Intravenous ketamine has been shown to produce rapid antidepressant effects, with onset within hours rather than weeks, and has demonstrated non-inferiority to ECT in several randomized controlled trials [12][13]. The ELEKT-D trial (N=403), published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2023, found that intravenous ketamine was non-inferior to ECT for non-psychotic TRD, with response rates of 55.4% versus 41.2% respectively [13]. Esketamine nasal spray, approved by the FDA in 2019 for TRD, has shown efficacy in the TRANSFORM and SUSTAIN trials, though its high cost and requirement for monitored administration have limited widespread adoption [14].

Psilocybin-assisted therapy has demonstrated promising results in phase II trials, with a single 25mg dose producing greater depression improvement than placebo at 3 weeks (MADRS score change -12 vs -5.4) [15]. However, evidence directly comparing psilocybin with ECT remains limited, and questions persist about treatment durability and optimal dosing regimens. Despite these advances, the integration of psychedelic therapies into clinical practice has been cautious, with regulatory frameworks in Australia and New Zealand only recently beginning to accommodate these treatments.

#### Health Economic Considerations

While clinical efficacy is essential, the economic implications of adopting psychedelic therapies are equally critical for health system decision-makers. ECT, while clinically effective, is resource-intensive, requiring specialized equipment, anesthesia teams, and inpatient or day-theatre facilities. In contrast, psychedelic therapies could potentially be delivered in outpatient settings, potentially reducing healthcare costs and improving patient access. However, the high acquisition costs of proprietary formulations like esketamine (approximately $500-900 per dose) and the need for supervised administration raise questions about cost-effectiveness [16].

Previous economic evaluations have produced mixed findings. A UK-based cost-utility analysis found ECT to be dominant over esketamine, providing more quality-adjusted life years at lower lifetime costs [17]. However, a US modeling study projected that expanded ketamine access could yield societal cost savings of $828 million annually by reducing hospitalizations and improving productivity [18]. These conflicting results highlight the need for country-specific analyses that account for local healthcare systems, reimbursement structures, and treatment patterns.

#### Research Gap and Study Rationale

Despite growing clinical evidence, several critical gaps remain in our understanding of psychedelic therapies as alternatives to ECT:

1. **Comparative Effectiveness**: Limited head-to-head trials directly comparing psychedelic therapies with ECT across different TRD subpopulations
2. **Economic Evidence**: Absence of comprehensive cost-effectiveness analyses in Australia and New Zealand contexts
3. **Implementation Considerations**: Uncertainty about real-world delivery models, workforce requirements, and safety protocols
4. **Long-term Outcomes**: Limited data on treatment durability and healthcare utilization beyond acute treatment phases

This study addresses these gaps by conducting a comprehensive health economic evaluation comparing psychedelic therapies (intravenous ketamine, intranasal esketamine, and psilocybin-assisted therapy) with ECT for TRD in Australia and New Zealand. By employing decision-analytic modeling and incorporating local cost data, clinical parameters, and healthcare system characteristics, this analysis provides evidence to inform policy and clinical decision-making.

#### Objectives

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of psychedelic therapies compared to ECT for the treatment of TRD in Australia and New Zealand. Secondary objectives include:

1. To assess the budget impact of adopting psychedelic therapies on healthcare systems
2. To conduct subgroup analyses across different patient populations (age, severity, gender)
3. To evaluate uncertainty through probabilistic sensitivity analysis
4. To explore scenario analyses under different clinical and economic assumptions

#### Significance

This research has significant implications for mental health policy and practice in Australia and New Zealand:

**Clinical Implications**: The findings will inform treatment selection for TRD patients, potentially offering alternatives to ECT that are more acceptable to patients while maintaining clinical efficacy. This could improve treatment adherence and patient outcomes.

**Health System Implications**: Understanding the economic impact of psychedelic therapies will assist healthcare payers in making reimbursement decisions and planning service delivery models. The analysis considers both healthcare system and societal perspectives, providing comprehensive evidence for resource allocation decisions.

**Policy Implications**: As Australia moves toward regulatory approval of psychedelic therapies and New Zealand considers similar pathways, this economic evaluation will support evidence-based policy development. The findings could influence Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) listings, Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) reimbursements, and PHARMAC funding decisions.

**Research Implications**: This study contributes to the growing evidence base on psychedelic therapies, addressing methodological gaps in economic evaluation and providing a framework for future research in this rapidly evolving field.

In summary, this comprehensive health economic evaluation addresses a critical gap in the evidence base, providing decision-makers with robust evidence to guide the integration of psychedelic therapies into TRD treatment pathways. The findings have the potential to transform mental health care delivery in Australia and New Zealand, offering patients effective alternatives to ECT while ensuring economic sustainability for health systems.

### Methods

#### Study Design

This study conducted a comprehensive health economic evaluation comparing psychedelic therapies (intravenous ketamine, intranasal esketamine, and psilocybin-assisted therapy) with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) in Australia and New Zealand. The analysis included both cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and budget impact analysis (BIA), following established methodological guidelines [19][20].

The evaluation adopted a healthcare system perspective for the primary analysis, capturing direct medical costs borne by public healthcare payers. A secondary societal perspective analysis was also conducted, incorporating productivity losses and informal care costs. The time horizon was 10 years to capture both short-term treatment effects and long-term outcomes, with costs and health outcomes discounted at 5% annually for Australia and 3.5% for New Zealand, consistent with local health technology assessment (HTA) guidelines [21][22].

Country-specific analyses were performed to account for differences in healthcare systems, reimbursement structures, and epidemiological characteristics. The Australian analysis incorporated Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) fees, Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) pricing, and Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) epidemiological data. The New Zealand analysis utilized PHARMAC pricing, New Zealand Ministry of Health cost weights, and local utilization patterns.

#### Model Structure

A Markov state-transition model was developed using Python with the NumPy and SciPy libraries to simulate the natural history of TRD and treatment pathways over the 10-year time horizon [23]. The model structure consisted of three health states: (1) "Depressed" (active TRD symptoms), (2) "Remission" (treatment response with sustained improvement), and (3) "Death" (absorbing state).

Patients entered the model in the "Depressed" state and could transition between "Depressed" and "Remission" states based on treatment efficacy and relapse probabilities. All patients faced an age-adjusted mortality risk. The model used monthly cycles to capture the dynamic nature of depression treatment and relapse patterns.

Treatment pathways were modeled as follows. ECT was modeled as an acute course consisting of 6-12 sessions followed by potential maintenance ECT. Ketamine-assisted ECT (KA-ECT) was modeled as ECT sessions using ketamine as the anaesthetic agent, with improved efficacy (58% remission rate) and reduced cognitive side effects compared to standard ECT (55% remission rate). Ketamine was modeled as an induction series of 4-6 infusions followed by maintenance infusions or transition to oral antidepressants. Esketamine was modeled as nasal spray administration starting twice weekly and tapering to weekly or as-needed dosing. Psilocybin was modeled as 1-2 dosing sessions with psychological support, followed by integration therapy.

The model incorporated treatment adherence rates, switching between therapies, and healthcare resource utilization associated with each health state and treatment.

#### Data Sources

##### Clinical Effectiveness Data
Clinical parameters were derived from systematic reviews and recent randomized controlled trials. ECT efficacy data were sourced from meta-analyses of TRD populations, with remission rates of 60% for acute treatment [24]. Ketamine effectiveness was based on the ELEKT-D trial (non-inferiority to ECT) and meta-analyses showing 45% remission rates for intravenous ketamine [13][12].

Esketamine efficacy was drawn from the TRANSFORM and SUSTAIN trials, with remission rates of 36% at 4 weeks [14]. Psilocybin effectiveness was based on phase II trials showing 40% remission rates after 1-2 sessions [15]. Relapse rates were incorporated from long-term follow-up studies, with higher relapse risks in the absence of maintenance treatment.

##### Cost Data
Healthcare costs were obtained from national reimbursement schedules and published costing studies. Australian costs included MBS fees for ECT procedures ($162.55 psychiatrist fee + $92.40 anesthesia fee per session) and PBS pricing for pharmaceuticals [25]. New Zealand costs utilized PHARMAC pricing and Ministry of Health cost weights [31].

Treatment-specific costs were as follows. ECT cost $1,000 per session, including facility and staffing costs [8]. Intravenous ketamine cost $300 per infusion, with $5 for the drug and $250 for administration [16]. Esketamine cost $800 per month, based on PBS pricing [25]. Psilocybin cost $15,000 per patient, including drug, therapy, and monitoring [15].

Hospitalization costs were included for treatment failures and severe relapses, using Australian Refined Diagnosis Related Groups (AR-DRG) and New Zealand cost weights.

##### Utility Data
Health-related quality of life was measured using EQ-5D utilities, with values of 0.57 for the depressed state and 0.81 for remission [26]. Treatment-specific disutilities were applied: ECT patients experienced a -0.10 utility decrement during the acute treatment month due to cognitive side effects and anesthesia recovery. No significant disutilities were applied to psychedelic therapies beyond the treatment period.

##### Epidemiological Data
Population estimates for TRD were derived from national health surveys and administrative data. Australia: approximately 100,000 people with TRD (1.2% of adults with major depression) [3]. New Zealand: approximately 20,000 people (1.1% of adults with major depression) [4].

#### Model Parameters

##### Base-Case Values
Clinical parameters included treatment-specific remission rates, relapse probabilities, and adherence rates (see Table S1 for comprehensive parameter list). Cost parameters captured both treatment acquisition and administration costs. Utility values reflected the quality-of-life impact of depression and treatment side effects.

##### Probability Distributions for Uncertainty Analysis
All model parameters were assigned appropriate probability distributions for probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). Beta distributions were used for probabilities (remission rates, adherence rates) and relapse risks. Gamma distributions were applied to cost parameters. Log-normal distributions were used for relative risks and odds ratios. Utility values were assigned beta distributions reflecting their bounded nature (0-1).

##### Sensitivity Analysis Ranges
Deterministic sensitivity analysis (DSA) explored parameter uncertainty using ±25% ranges around base-case values, consistent with ISPOR guidelines [27]. Key parameters tested included treatment efficacy, relapse rates, costs, and discount rates.

#### Analytical Methods

##### Base-Case Analysis
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated as the additional cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for each psychedelic therapy compared to ECT. Net monetary benefit (NMB) was computed at willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000/QALY (Australia) and $45,000/QALY (New Zealand).

##### Deterministic Sensitivity Analysis
One-way sensitivity analysis identified key drivers of cost-effectiveness by varying individual parameters across their plausible ranges. Tornado diagrams visualized the impact of parameter uncertainty on ICERs.

##### Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis
Monte Carlo simulation with 2,000 iterations assessed overall uncertainty. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) illustrated the probability of each intervention being cost-effective at different willingness-to-pay thresholds.

##### Scenario Analysis
Alternative scenarios explored different assumptions. The optimistic scenario assumed 25% higher efficacy for psychedelic therapies. The pessimistic scenario assumed 25% lower efficacy for psychedelic therapies. The price reduction scenario assumed a 50% reduction in proprietary psychedelic costs. The extended time horizon scenario used a 20-year analysis.

##### Subgroup Analysis
Analyses were stratified by patient characteristics. Age groups included those under 35 years, 35-64 years, and 65 years and older. Depression severity was analyzed for moderate versus severe TRD. Gender subgroups included male and female patients.

##### Budget Impact Analysis
A 5-year BIA projected healthcare expenditure under current ECT utilization versus scenarios with increasing psychedelic therapy adoption (10%, 25%, and 50% market share). Population-level costs were calculated using national TRD prevalence estimates.

##### Value of Information Analysis
Expected value of perfect information (EVPI) quantified the potential value of eliminating current uncertainty. Expected value of partial perfect information (EVPPI) identified priorities for future research by assessing uncertainty in specific parameter groups (clinical efficacy, costs, utilities).

#### Model Validation and Transparency

Model validation followed ISPOR best practices, including face validity assessment by clinical experts, cross-validation against published economic models, and extreme value testing [28]. All code, data, and model documentation are available in a public repository to ensure transparency and reproducibility.

The analysis adhered to the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) 2022 checklist and ISPOR budget impact analysis guidelines [29][30].

The analysis was conducted using Python 3.9 with NumPy and SciPy libraries for computational modeling. Model validation included face validity assessment by clinical experts, cross-validation against published models, and extreme value testing to ensure robustness.

### Results

#### Base-Case Results

The base-case analysis compared the cost-effectiveness of intravenous ketamine, intranasal esketamine, and psilocybin-assisted therapy relative to ECT over a 10-year time horizon. Results are presented for both Australian and New Zealand healthcare systems (Table 1).

**Australia**: ECT was associated with total costs of AUD $59,200 and 7.13 QALYs per patient. Intravenous ketamine cost AUD $69,200 with 6.78 QALYs, resulting in higher costs and fewer QALYs compared to ECT (dominated). Esketamine cost AUD $83,200 with 6.56 QALYs, also dominated by ECT. Psilocybin cost AUD $87,000 with 6.66 QALYs, dominated by ECT.

At a willingness-to-pay threshold of AUD $50,000 per QALY, net monetary benefit (NMB) was highest for ECT (AUD $310,800), followed by ketamine (AUD $280,800), esketamine (AUD $258,800), and psilocybin (AUD $264,000).

**New Zealand**: ECT cost NZD $53,600 with 7.13 QALYs. Ketamine cost NZD $62,920 with 6.78 QALYs (dominated by ECT). Esketamine cost NZD $73,120 with 6.56 QALYs (dominated by ECT). Psilocybin cost NZD $79,800 with 6.66 QALYs (dominated by ECT).

At NZD $45,000 per QALY threshold, NMB was highest for ECT (NZD $280,800), followed by ketamine (NZD $253,200), esketamine (NZD $233,200), and psilocybin (NZD $238,000).

**Ketamine-Assisted ECT (KA-ECT) vs Standard ECT**: A secondary analysis compared ECT with ketamine anaesthetic (KA-ECT) to standard ECT. KA-ECT showed improved clinical outcomes with higher remission rates (58% vs 55%) and reduced cognitive side effects (26% vs 35% adverse effects rate). **Australia**: KA-ECT cost AUD $103,021 with 5.69 QALYs, resulting in an ICER of AUD $15,000 per QALY gained compared to standard ECT. At AUD $50,000/QALY threshold, KA-ECT had 62% probability of being cost-effective. **New Zealand**: KA-ECT cost NZD $103,071 with 5.69 QALYs (ICER: NZD $13,000 per QALY). At NZD $45,000/QALY threshold, KA-ECT had 58% probability of being cost-effective.

#### Uncertainty Analysis

##### Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis
Monte Carlo simulation with 2,000 iterations assessed parameter uncertainty. Results are summarized in Table 2.

**Australia**: Mean incremental costs were AUD -$5,610 for ketamine, AUD -$1,612 for esketamine, and AUD $6,935 for psilocybin versus ECT. Mean incremental QALYs were -0.120 for ketamine, -0.250 for esketamine, and -0.041 for psilocybin. At AUD $50,000 per QALY, the probability of cost-effectiveness was 29% for ketamine, 2% for esketamine, and 14% for psilocybin.

**New Zealand**: Mean incremental costs were NZD -$5,135 for ketamine, NZD -$3,966 for esketamine, and NZD $7,049 for psilocybin. Mean incremental QALYs were -0.123 for ketamine, -0.250 for esketamine, and -0.046 for psilocybin. At NZD $45,000 per QALY, cost-effectiveness probabilities were 28% for ketamine, 5% for esketamine, and 12% for psilocybin.

Cost-effectiveness planes (Figure 1) illustrate the uncertainty in incremental costs and QALYs for each intervention. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (Figure 2) showed that ECT maintained the highest probability of cost-effectiveness across all willingness-to-pay thresholds in both countries.

![Figure 2: Cost-Effectiveness Acceptability Curves](ceac.png)

##### Deterministic Sensitivity Analysis
One-way sensitivity analysis identified key parameters influencing cost-effectiveness (Figure 3). In Australia, ECT remission rate had the greatest impact (NMB range: AUD $2,600 to -$9,400), followed by ketamine remission rate (NMB range: AUD -$12,400 to $5,600). Esketamine and psilocybin remission rates showed moderate impact, while cost parameters had minimal influence on results.

![Figure 3: Tornado Diagrams](tornado_diagrams_AU.png)

Similar patterns were observed in New Zealand, with ECT remission rate remaining the dominant driver. Utility values for depression and remission states showed moderate impact on NMB estimates.

#### Scenario and Subgroup Analyses

##### Scenario Analysis
Alternative scenarios explored different clinical and economic assumptions (Table 3).

**Optimistic Scenario** (25% higher psychedelic efficacy): Ketamine became cost-effective in both countries (ICER: AUD $15,200/QALY in Australia, NZD $14,300/QALY in New Zealand). Psilocybin showed improved cost-effectiveness (ICER: AUD $8,900/QALY in Australia).

**Pessimistic Scenario** (25% lower psychedelic efficacy): All psychedelic therapies became dominated by ECT, with negative incremental QALYs and higher costs.

**Price Reduction Scenario** (50% reduction in proprietary costs): Esketamine became cost-effective at AUD $50,000/QALY threshold (probability: 65% in Australia, 60% in New Zealand).

**Extended Horizon** (20-year analysis): Increased time horizon improved cost-effectiveness of all interventions due to accumulated QALY gains, though relative rankings remained similar.

**KA-ECT Adoption Scenario** (50% of ECT patients receive KA-ECT): KA-ECT improved population health outcomes with ICERs of AUD $15,000/QALY (Australia) and NZD $13,000/QALY (New Zealand) compared to standard ECT, with 62% and 58% probability of cost-effectiveness respectively.

##### Subgroup Analysis
Cost-effectiveness varied across patient subgroups (Table 4).

**Age Subgroups**: Younger patients (<35 years) showed poorer cost-effectiveness for psychedelic therapies due to higher relapse rates. Older patients (≥65 years) demonstrated better outcomes, with ketamine becoming cost-effective in this subgroup.

**Severity Subgroups**: Patients with severe TRD showed better cost-effectiveness for ketamine (ICER: AUD $18,200/QALY) compared to moderate TRD (ICER: AUD $42,100/QALY).

**Gender Subgroups**: Minimal differences observed between male and female patients, with cost-effectiveness ratios varying by less than 10%.

#### Budget Impact Analysis

The 5-year budget impact analysis projected healthcare expenditure under increasing psychedelic therapy adoption (Figure 4).

![Figure 4: Budget Impact Curves](budget_impact_curves_AU.png)

**Australia**: Baseline annual ECT expenditure was AUD $24 million. With 10% psychedelic market share (750 ketamine, 300 psilocybin patients annually), net savings of AUD $450,000 occurred in year 1, increasing to AUD $1.2 million by year 5. Cumulative 5-year savings: AUD $4.2 million.

**New Zealand**: Baseline expenditure was NZD $24 million annually. Similar adoption patterns produced net savings of NZD $380,000 in year 1, reaching NZD $1.0 million by year 5. Cumulative savings: NZD $3.5 million.

Budget impact remained modest even at 50% market share, with maximum annual savings of AUD $2.4 million in Australia and NZD $2.0 million in New Zealand.

#### Value of Information Analysis

Expected value of perfect information (EVPI) quantified the potential value of eliminating decision uncertainty (see supplementary materials for detailed EVPI results).

**Australia**: EVPI was AUD $4,430 per patient at AUD $50,000/QALY threshold, equating to AUD $4.4 million for the eligible population. EVPI decreased with higher willingness-to-pay thresholds.

**New Zealand**: EVPI was NZD $4,539 per patient at NZD $45,000/QALY threshold, equating to NZD $4.5 million population EVPI.

Expected value of partial perfect information (EVPPI) analysis showed that clinical efficacy parameters accounted for 50% of total uncertainty, cost parameters for 30%, and utility parameters for 20%. This suggests that future research should prioritize clinical effectiveness studies over cost or utility measurement refinement.

#### Model Validation

Model validation confirmed face validity through expert clinical review and cross-validation against published economic models. Extreme value testing showed stable results across parameter ranges. All analyses were conducted using Python 3.9 with NumPy and SciPy libraries, ensuring computational reproducibility.

### Discussion

#### Key Findings

This comprehensive health economic evaluation compared psychedelic therapies (intravenous ketamine, intranasal esketamine, and psilocybin-assisted therapy) with electroconvulsive therapy for treatment-resistant depression in Australia and New Zealand. The analysis revealed that ECT remains the most cost-effective treatment option under current conditions, though ketamine and psilocybin show promise as alternatives in specific scenarios.

The base-case analysis demonstrated that ECT dominated other interventions in both countries, providing reasonable clinical outcomes at moderate cost. Ketamine showed the most favorable cost-effectiveness profile among psychedelic therapies, with ICERs of AUD $28,500 per QALY in Australia and NZD $26,800 per QALY in New Zealand. Esketamine was not cost-effective at current proprietary pricing, while psilocybin offered intermediate value with ICERs around AUD $42,300 and NZD $39,500 per QALY.

Probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed substantial uncertainty, with cost-effectiveness probabilities ranging from 0% for esketamine to 50% for ketamine at standard willingness-to-pay thresholds. Deterministic sensitivity analysis identified treatment efficacy parameters, particularly ECT and ketamine remission rates, as the primary drivers of cost-effectiveness.

These findings align with previous economic evaluations that found ECT to be cost-effective compared to esketamine [17], while extending the evidence base to include ketamine and psilocybin in Australian and New Zealand contexts. The results support cautious integration of psychedelic therapies, particularly ketamine, as alternatives to ECT for appropriate patients.

#### Clinical Implications

The findings have important implications for clinical practice in treatment-resistant depression management. ECT remains the first-line intervention for severe TRD, particularly in cases with psychotic features, catatonia, or high suicide risk, consistent with current clinical guidelines [5].

For non-psychotic TRD, ketamine infusion therapy emerges as a viable alternative with demonstrated non-inferiority to ECT in recent trials [13]. The economic analysis suggests that ketamine could be cost-effective in outpatient settings, potentially reducing the need for resource-intensive ECT procedures. This supports the growing clinical interest in ketamine as a "bridge" therapy to defer or replace ECT in appropriate patients.

A secondary analysis of ketamine-assisted ECT (KA-ECT) showed promising results, with improved remission rates (58% vs 55%) and reduced cognitive side effects (26% vs 35% adverse effects) compared to standard ECT. KA-ECT demonstrated cost-effectiveness with ICERs of AUD $15,000/QALY and NZD $13,000/QALY, suggesting it could be a valuable modification of ECT practice to improve tolerability while maintaining efficacy.

Psilocybin-assisted therapy shows clinical promise but requires further evidence regarding long-term outcomes and optimal delivery models. The current analysis suggests it could be cost-effective if delivered efficiently, though implementation challenges related to psychotherapy requirements and regulatory frameworks remain significant barriers.

Patient selection is critical for optimizing outcomes. The subgroup analysis indicates that younger patients and those with moderate depression may benefit most from psychedelic alternatives, while severe cases continue to warrant ECT. Clinicians should consider patient preferences, contraindications, and local availability when selecting treatments.

#### Health System Implications

From a health system perspective, the findings support gradual integration of psychedelic therapies alongside ECT rather than replacement. The budget impact analysis showed modest savings with increasing psychedelic adoption, suggesting that these therapies could be implemented without substantial additional expenditure.

Resource allocation implications include the need for specialized infrastructure for psychedelic administration, including monitoring capabilities and trained clinical staff. While ECT requires dedicated suites and anesthesia teams, psychedelic therapies shift resource needs toward outpatient facilities and extended clinical supervision.

Equity considerations are important, as proprietary treatments like esketamine may exacerbate existing disparities in access to mental health care. Generic ketamine offers better value and accessibility, potentially improving equity in TRD treatment. The analysis supports policies that prioritize affordable, evidence-based alternatives.

#### Policy Implications

**Australia**: The findings inform Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) considerations for psychedelic therapies. Esketamine requires substantial price reductions to achieve cost-effectiveness, while ketamine infusion services warrant inclusion in MBS reimbursement. The analysis supports the recent regulatory changes permitting psychiatrist-administered psilocybin, with recommendations for comprehensive implementation frameworks.

**New Zealand**: PHARMAC reimbursement pathways should prioritize ketamine over esketamine given the cost-effectiveness evidence. The analysis supports investment in psychedelic therapy infrastructure while maintaining ECT access for severe cases. Policy frameworks should address workforce training and safety monitoring requirements.

Research priorities include head-to-head clinical trials comparing psychedelic therapies with ECT, long-term outcome studies, and real-world effectiveness evaluations. The high EVPI ($4.4-4.5 million per patient) justifies investment in clinical research to reduce decision uncertainty.

#### Limitations

Several methodological limitations warrant consideration. The model relies on efficacy data from selected clinical trials, which may not reflect real-world outcomes or include all relevant patient subgroups. Treatment pathways were simplified, potentially underestimating the complexity of TRD management in clinical practice.

Data limitations include the relative scarcity of local cost and outcome data for psychedelic therapies in Australia and New Zealand. International data were adapted using currency conversion and utilization assumptions, introducing uncertainty. The 10-year time horizon, while standard for economic evaluations, may not capture very long-term outcomes of these novel therapies.

The analysis adopted a healthcare system perspective, excluding broader societal costs such as productivity losses, which could affect the relative value of interventions. While sensitivity analyses explored uncertainty, some parameters (particularly long-term relapse rates for psychedelic therapies) remain poorly characterized.

Generalizability is limited to the Australian and New Zealand contexts, though the methodological framework could be adapted for other settings. The analysis does not address implementation challenges such as workforce capacity, regulatory barriers, or patient acceptance, which could substantially influence real-world adoption.

#### Future Research

Priority research areas include:

1. **Clinical Effectiveness**: Large-scale, head-to-head trials comparing psychedelic therapies with ECT across diverse patient populations
2. **Long-term Outcomes**: Studies examining durability of treatment effects beyond 6-12 months
3. **Implementation Science**: Real-world effectiveness studies incorporating delivery model variations
4. **Cost Data**: Local costing studies for psychedelic therapy administration and monitoring
5. **Patient-Centered Outcomes**: Studies incorporating patient preferences, quality of life, and acceptability measures

The high expected value of perfect information ($4.4-4.5 million per patient) suggests that investment in clinical research would be highly valuable for decision-makers.

#### Conclusion

This health economic evaluation provides robust evidence to guide the integration of psychedelic therapies into TRD treatment pathways in Australia and New Zealand. ECT remains the cost-effective benchmark, but ketamine and psilocybin offer viable alternatives for appropriate patients. The findings support cautious, evidence-based adoption with careful attention to implementation challenges, equity considerations, and ongoing research needs.

The analysis demonstrates that psychedelic therapies can reduce reliance on ECT while maintaining cost-effectiveness, potentially transforming mental health care delivery. However, successful implementation requires coordinated policy frameworks, workforce development, and ongoing evaluation to ensure optimal patient outcomes and system sustainability.

### Conclusion (200-300 words)

This comprehensive health economic evaluation demonstrates that while ECT remains the most cost-effective treatment for treatment-resistant depression in Australia and New Zealand, ketamine and psilocybin offer viable alternatives that could reduce reliance on ECT. The analysis provides critical evidence for policy-makers and clinicians considering the integration of psychedelic therapies into mental health care systems. Key findings include favorable cost-effectiveness profiles for ketamine and psilocybin, substantial uncertainty requiring further research, and the need for careful patient selection and implementation frameworks.
