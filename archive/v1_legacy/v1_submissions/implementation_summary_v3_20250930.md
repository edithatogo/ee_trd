- **Enhanced Cost Data**: Detailed societal cost components (time: A$45.50/hour, travel: A$0.85/km, productivity: A$385/day, informal care: A$65/hour)

### Results Section Expansion ✅
- **Extended Sensitivity Analyses**: Added two-way sensitivity, threshold analysis, value-based pricing analysis
- **Societal Perspective Impact**: Comprehensive analysis of societal cost additions across treatment strategies
- **Robustness Analysis**: Demonstrated oral ketamine stability across wide parameter ranges
- **Value-Based Pricing**: Showed 86-fold pricing premium potential for oral ketamine

### Discussion Updates ✅
- **Key Findings Transformation**: Complete rewrite emphasizing oral ketamine dominance
- **Clinical Implications**: Repositioned ECT as specialized treatment, PO-KA as first-line
- **Policy Implications**: Transformed recommendations to support immediate implementation
- **Research Priorities**: Updated to focus on optimal oral ketamine implementation

## Phase 3: Figures, Tables, and References ✅ COMPLETED

### Figures and Tables Update ✅
- **10 New Figures**: Complete figure replacement with V3 corrected data and dual-perspective analysis
- **Dual-Perspective Visualization**: Added cost comparison, net benefit comparison, and perspective-specific CE planes
- **Enhanced Captions**: Detailed figure descriptions explaining V3 findings and dual-perspective insights
- **Table 1 Enhancement**: Complete cost-effectiveness table with ICERs, net benefits, and strategy rankings

### References Update ✅
- **18 New References**: Added all new citations in EndNote format with appropriate record numbers
- **Dual File Updates**: Updated both .ris and .bib files with new references
- **Methodological Citations**: Added references for dual-perspective methodology, societal costing, V3 corrections
- **Policy Citations**: Added Australian and New Zealand policy framework references

## Key Transformations Achieved

### 1. **Primary Finding Shift**
- **From**: "ECT remains the most cost-effective treatment"
- **To**: "Oral ketamine emerges as the dominant strategy"

### 2. **Economic Evidence Strengthening**
- **From**: Limited single-perspective analysis
- **To**: Comprehensive dual-perspective framework with robust sensitivity analysis

### 3. **Policy Stance Evolution**
- **From**: "Cautious integration of psychedelic therapies"

### 4. **Clinical Practice Impact**
- **From**: "ECT as first-line with ketamine as alternative"
- **To**: "Oral ketamine as first-line with ECT for specialized cases"

### 5. **Evidence Base Enhancement**
- **From**: 4 treatment strategies with limited analysis
- **To**: 7 treatment strategies with comprehensive economic evaluation
