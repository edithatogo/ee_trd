# Cost-Effectiveness of Ketamine, Esketamine, and Psilocybin vs Electroconvulsive Therapy for Treatment-Resistant Depression in Australia and New Zealand

## Abstract

### Background

Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) affects 20-30% of patients with major depressive disorder and represents a significant economic burden. While electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has historically been considered the gold standard—particularly for severe or psychotic depression—oral ketamine therapy has emerged as a highly cost-effective alternative across broader TRD populations, alongside intranasal esketamine and psilocybin-assisted therapy. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of seven treatment strategies including oral ketamine, intravenous ketamine, intranasal esketamine, psilocybin-assisted therapy, ketamine-assisted ECT, and standard ECT compared to usual care in Australia and New Zealand using both health system and societal perspectives.

### Methods

A comprehensive economic evaluation employed Markov state-transition modeling to simulate TRD progression over 10 years from dual perspectives (health system and societal). Clinical parameters were derived from randomized trials, meta-analyses, and real-world evidence. The dual-perspective framework incorporated comprehensive societal costs including patient time (hourly rate: A$45.50), travel costs (A$0.85/km), productivity losses (A$385/day), informal care (A$65/hour), and out-of-pocket expenses. Treatment strategies were modeled with realistic clinical pathways: ECT as 8-session acute courses with selective maintenance; ketamine therapies with induction and maintenance phases; psilocybin as 1-2 supervised sessions with psychological support. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (2,000 iterations) assessed uncertainty alongside comprehensive budget impact, value-based pricing, and value of information analyses.

### Results

Oral ketamine (PO-KA) emerged as the most cost-effective strategy with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of A$1,021/QALY from the health system perspective, achieving 98% probability of cost-effectiveness at A$50,000/QALY threshold. Net monetary benefits were highest for PO-KA (A$118,450), followed by ketamine-assisted ECT (A$111,926), standard ECT (A$109,586), and intravenous ketamine (A$102,583). Intranasal esketamine showed poor cost-effectiveness (ICER: A$171,426/QALY) while psilocybin had intermediate performance (ICER: A$105,311/QALY). Societal perspective analysis confirmed PO-KA dominance despite additional costs of A$3,985 per patient. Five-year budget impact projections showed manageable cost increases (A$71.1M health system) with substantial return on investment (4.99:1) when accounting for health benefits valued at A$1.04B.

### Conclusions

Oral ketamine represents a paradigm shift in TRD treatment, offering superior cost-effectiveness compared to traditional ECT and other psychedelic therapies. The dual-perspective analysis confirms robust cost-effectiveness across societal contexts, supporting implementation in Australian and New Zealand health systems. Policy recommendations include prioritizing oral ketamine for first-line psychedelic intervention, selective use of ketamine-assisted ECT for severe cases, and gradual integration with comprehensive monitoring frameworks. The findings justify immediate consideration for Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme listing and Medicare Benefits Schedule inclusion, with substantial value demonstrated through multiple economic evaluation methodologies.

# Main Text

## Introduction

### Background and Rationale

Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) represents a significant and growing challenge for mental health systems worldwide, affecting approximately 20-30% of patients with major depressive disorder who fail to respond adequately to at least two adequate trials of antidepressant medication {Rush, 2006 \#1;Fava, 2003 \#2}. In Australia and New Zealand, TRD contributes substantially to the burden of disease, with estimates suggesting that up to 100,000 Australians and 20,000 New Zealanders may experience TRD at any given time {, 2023 \#3;, 2022 \#4}. The condition is associated with profound functional impairment, increased risk of suicide, and substantial healthcare costs, making effective treatment interventions a priority for health systems.

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been considered the gold standard intervention for TRD, particularly when accompanied by psychotic features, catatonia, or high suicide risk {Malhi, 2021 \#110;Weiss, 2019 \#111;, 2019 \#112;Rogers, 2023 \#113;, 2001 \#5}. ECT involves the induction of controlled seizures under anesthesia, typically administered 2-3 times per week for 6-12 sessions. While ECT demonstrates robust efficacy, with response rates of 60-80% in TRD populations, its use has declined in recent decades due to concerns about cognitive side effects, anesthesia risks, and patient stigma {Read, 2019 \#6;Leiknes, 2012 \#7}. In Australia, ECT utilization rates have fallen from approximately 5.6 per 10,000 population in the early 2000s to around 2.8 per 10,000 in recent years, while New Zealand rates remain similarly low at approximately 2.0 per 10,000 {, 2023 \#3;, 2022 \#4}.

The limitations of conventional pharmacotherapy and ECT have spurred interest in novel therapeutic approaches, with psychedelic-assisted therapies emerging as a promising alternative. Ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic originally developed in the 1960s, has demonstrated rapid and robust antidepressant effects. Originally delivered *intravenously*, ketamine’s antidepressant efficacy has since been demonstrated via *intramuscular, subcutaneous, and oral* routes (including an *extended-release oral tablet*), with meta-analytic evidence for clinically meaningful effects; intranasal *esketamine* is also effective as an adjunct. {Berman, 2000 \#10}. More recently, classical psychedelics such as psilocybin have shown transformative potential in treating depression, particularly when combined with psychological support {Griffiths, 2016 \#11}. These therapies offer several theoretical advantages over ECT, including potentially fewer cognitive side effects, outpatient administration (noting that ECT is also often given to outpatients), and more acceptable treatment experiences for patients.

### Current Evidence Base

Clinical evidence supporting novel therapies has grown substantially in recent years. Intravenous ketamine has been shown to produce rapid antidepressant effects, with onset within hours rather than weeks, and has demonstrated non-inferiority to ECT in several randomized controlled trials {Newport, 2015 \#12;Correia-Melo, 2023 \#13}. The ELEKT-D trial (N=403), published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2023, found that intravenous ketamine was non-inferior to ECT for non-psychotic TRD, with response rates of 55.4% versus 41.2% respectively {Correia-Melo, 2023 \#13}. Esketamine nasal spray, approved by the FDA in 2019 for TRD, has shown efficacy in the TRANSFORM and SUSTAIN trials phase 3 trials *when given with a newly initiated oral antidepressant,* and reduced relapse risk when *continued alongside an oral antidepressant* in randomized withdrawal; its high cost and requirement for monitored administration have limited widespread adoption {Daly, 2018 \#14}.

Psilocybin-assisted therapy has demonstrated promising results in phase II trials, with a single 25mg dose producing greater depression improvement than placebo at 3 weeks (MADRS score change -12 vs -5.4) {Davis, 2020 \#15}. However, evidence directly comparing psilocybin with ECT remains limited, and questions persist about treatment durability and optimal dosing regimens. Despite these advances, integration into routine care has been cautious. Key concerns include adequacy of blinding and the contribution of non-specific effects, sustainability of effects and relapse risk, and limited generalisability from tightly controlled trials. with regulatory frameworks in Australia and New Zealand only recently beginning to accommodate these treatments {Kisely, 2023 \#114;Kisely, 2023 \#115}.

### Health Economic Considerations

While clinical efficacy is essential, the economic implications of adopting psychedelic therapies are important critical for health system decision-makers. ECT, while clinically effective, is resource-intensive, requiring specialized equipment, anesthesia teams, and inpatient or day-theatre facilities. In contrast, psychedelic therapies could potentially be delivered in outpatient settings, potentially reducing healthcare costs and improving patient access. However, the high acquisition costs of proprietary formulations like esketamine (approximately \$500-900 per dose) and the need for supervised administration raise questions about cost-effectiveness {Jansen, 2021 \#16}.

Previous economic evaluations have produced mixed findings. A UK-based cost-utility analysis found ECT to be dominant over esketamine, providing more quality-adjusted life years at lower lifetime costs {Platt, 2021 \#17}. However, a US modeling study projected that expanded ketamine access could yield societal cost savings of \$828 million annually by reducing hospitalizations and improving productivity {McMillan, 2022 \#18}. These conflicting results highlight the need for country-specific analyses that account for local healthcare systems, reimbursement structures, and treatment patterns.

### Research Gap and Study Rationale

Despite growing clinical evidence, several critical gaps remain in our understanding of psychedelic therapies as alternatives to ECT:

1.  *Comparative Effectiveness:* Limited head-to-head trials directly comparing psychedelic therapies with ECT across different TRD subpopulations

2.  *Economic Evidence:* Absence of comprehensive cost-effectiveness analyses in Australia and New Zealand contexts

3.  *Implementation Considerations:* Uncertainty about real-world delivery models, workforce requirements, and safety protocols

4.  *Long-term Outcomes:* Limited data on treatment durability and healthcare utilization beyond acute treatment phases

This study addresses these gaps by conducting a comprehensive economic evaluation comparing psychedelic therapies (intravenous ketamine, intranasal esketamine, and psilocybin-assisted therapy) with ECT for TRD in Australia and New Zealand. By employing decision-analytic modeling and incorporating local cost data, clinical parameters, and healthcare system characteristics, this analysis provides evidence to inform policy and clinical decision-making.

### Objectives

The primary objective of this current study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of psychedelic therapies compared to ECT for the treatment of TRD in Australia and New Zealand. Secondary objectives include:

1.  To assess the budget impact of adopting psychedelic therapies on healthcare systems

2.  To conduct subgroup analyses across different patient populations (age, severity, gender)

3.  To evaluate uncertainty through probabilistic sensitivity analysis

4.  To explore scenario analyses under different clinical and economic assumptions

### Significance

This research has significant implications for mental health policy and practice in Australia and New Zealand:

*Clinical Implications:* The findings will inform treatment selection for TRD patients, potentially offering alternatives to ECT that are more acceptable to patients while maintaining clinical efficacy. This could improve treatment adherence and patient outcomes.

*Health System Implications:* Understanding the economic impact of psychedelic therapies will assist healthcare payers in making reimbursement decisions and planning service delivery models. The analysis considers both healthcare system and societal perspectives, providing comprehensive evidence for resource allocation decisions.

*Policy Implications:* As Australia moves toward regulatory approval of psychedelic therapies and New Zealand considers similar pathways, this economic evaluation will support evidence-based policy development. The findings could influence Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) listings, Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) reimbursements, and PHARMAC funding decisions.

*Research Implications:* This study contributes to the growing evidence base on psychedelic therapies, addressing methodological gaps in economic evaluation and providing a framework for future research in this rapidly evolving field.

In summary, this comprehensive health economic evaluation addresses a critical gap in the evidence base, providing decision-makers with robust evidence to guide the integration of psychedelic therapies into TRD treatment pathways. The findings have the potential to transform mental health care delivery in Australia and New Zealand, offering patients effective alternatives to ECT while ensuring economic sustainability for health systems.

## Methods

### Study Design

This study conducted a comprehensive health economic evaluation comparing seven treatment strategies for treatment-resistant depression (TRD): oral ketamine (PO-KA), intravenous ketamine (IV-KA), intranasal esketamine (IN-EKA), psilocybin-assisted therapy, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), ketamine-assisted ECT (KA-ECT), and usual care in Australia and New Zealand. The analysis employed both cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and budget impact analysis (BIA), following established methodological guidelines and incorporating the Version 3 (V3) corrected clinical parameters {Husereau, 2013 #19;Sullivan, 2014 #20}.

*V3 Correction Methodology*: The evaluation utilized Version 3 corrected clinical effectiveness parameters derived from comprehensive meta-analysis of actual clinical data rather than preliminary estimates used in earlier iterations. This correction incorporated real-world effectiveness data from 18 randomized controlled trials and 6 observational studies, providing robust clinical foundations for economic modeling {Beaglehole, 2025 #119;Davis, 2025 #120}.

*Dual-Perspective Framework*: The evaluation adopted both healthcare system and societal perspectives for comprehensive economic assessment. The primary healthcare system perspective captured direct medical costs borne by public healthcare payers, while the secondary societal perspective incorporated broader economic impacts including patient time costs (A$45.50/hour), travel expenses (A$0.85/km), productivity losses (A$385/day), informal care provision (A$65/hour), and out-of-pocket expenditures (A$85/session copayments). This dual-perspective approach enables comprehensive policy assessment across different stakeholder viewpoints {Byford, 2003 #121;Knapp, 2013 #122}. The time horizon was 10 years to capture both short-term treatment effects and long-term outcomes, with costs and health outcomes discounted at 5% annually for Australia and 3.5% for New Zealand, consistent with local health technology assessment (HTA) guidelines {, 2023 \#21;, 2022 \#22}.

Country-specific analyses were performed to account for differences in healthcare systems, reimbursement structures, and epidemiological characteristics. The Australian analysis incorporated Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) fees, Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) pricing, and Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) epidemiological data. The New Zealand analysis utilized PHARMAC pricing, New Zealand Ministry of Health cost weights, and local utilization patterns.

### Model Structure

A Markov state-transition model was developed using Python with the NumPy and SciPy libraries to simulate the natural history of TRD and treatment pathways over the 10-year time horizon {Sonnenberg, 1993 \#23}. The model structure consisted of three health states: (1) “Depressed” (active TRD symptoms), (2) “Remission” (treatment response with sustained improvement), and (3) “Death” (absorbing state).

Patients entered the model in the “Depressed” state and could transition between “Depressed” and “Remission” states based on treatment efficacy and relapse probabilities. We acknowledge that many ‘remitted’ patients exhibit residual symptoms that carry lower utility and higher relapse risk; we therefore ran sensitivity/structural analyses to capture partial remission effects on QALYs and relapse. All patients faced an age-adjusted mortality risk. The model used monthly cycles to capture the dynamic nature of depression treatment and relapse patterns.

Treatment pathways were modeled as follows. ECT was modeled as an acute 8-session course delivered over the first model month (sensitivity: 6–12 sessions). In responders, a minority received maintenance ECT- 10% in Australia and 5% in New Zealand- implemented as a utilization parameter with an annual relapse probability of 0.30 while on maintenance. We did not parameterize a specific maintenance schedule (e.g., weekly to monthly taper); maintenance was represented via utilization and relapse parameters within monthly cycles of the Markov model. Ketamine-assisted ECT (KA-ECT) was modeled as ECT delivered under ketamine anesthesia. Given mixed evidence (early improvement possible but no consistent end-of-course advantage vs other anesthetics), we did not assume superior efficacy; KA-ECT was explored in scenario analyses. IV ketamine was modeled as an induction series of 4–6 infusions, followed by maintenance infusions for \~4 months; thereafter patients either discontinue ketamine or transition to oral antidepressants. Esketamine was modeled as nasal spray administration starting twice weekly and tapering to weekly or as-needed dosing. Psilocybin was modeled as 1–2 dosing sessions with psychological support and integration. Efficacy inputs were taken from MDD randomized trials (not restricted to TRD) and applied to the TRD cohort; long-term durability was represented via waning with a median of 6 months (range 3–12). Because long-term relapse rates remain uncertain, we implemented waning of effect with a median duration of 6 months (range 3–12 months) based on published follow-ups and tested broader ranges in sensitivity analyses.

The model incorporated treatment adherence rates, switching between therapies, and healthcare resource utilization associated with each health state and treatment.

### Data Sources

#### Clinical Effectiveness Data

Clinical parameters were derived from systematic reviews and recent randomized controlled trials. ECT efficacy data were sourced from meta-analyses of TRD populations, with remission rates of 60% for acute treatment {Group, 2003 \#24}. Ketamine effectiveness was based on the ELEKT-D trial (non-inferiority to ECT) and meta-analyses showing 45% remission rates for intravenous ketamine {Correia-Melo, 2023 \#13;Newport, 2015 \#12}.

Esketamine efficacy was drawn from the TRANSFORM and SUSTAIN trials, with remission rates of 36% at 4 weeks {Daly, 2018 \#14}. Psilocybin effectiveness was based on phase II trials showing 40% remission rates after 1-2 sessions {Davis, 2020 \#15}. Relapse inputs were treatment-specific. For maintenance ECT, we used an annual relapse probability of 0.30. For ketamine/esketamine, we used on-maintenance relapse over \~4 months = 0.267 (from the esketamine SUSTAIN program, applied as a proxy where direct IV ketamine maintenance data were lacking) and off-maintenance 1-year relapse = 0.60. For psilocybin, long-term relapse data are limited, so we modeled waning of effect with a median duration of 6 months (range 3–12) rather than a fixed relapse rate (see Table S1).

### Cost Data

*Healthcare System Costs*: Healthcare costs were obtained from national reimbursement schedules and published costing studies. Australian costs included MBS fees for ECT procedures ($162.55 psychiatrist fee + $92.40 anesthesia fee per session) and PBS pricing for pharmaceuticals {AIHW, 2024 #25}. New Zealand costs utilized PHARMAC pricing and Ministry of Health cost weights {MOH, 2024 #71}.

Treatment-specific costs were as follows: ECT cost $1,000 per session, including facility and staffing costs {Kisely, 2023 #8}. Intravenous ketamine cost $300 per infusion, with $5 for the drug and $250 for administration {Jansen, 2021 #16}. *Oral ketamine cost $45 per treatment episode, including compounding and dispensing fees* {Beaglehole, 2025 #123}. Esketamine cost $800 per month, based on PBS pricing {AIHW, 2024 #25}. Psilocybin cost A$15,000 (AU) / NZ$15,000 (NZ) per patient at 2024 prices, including drug, therapy, and monitoring {Davis, 2020 #15}.

*Societal Cost Components*: The dual-perspective framework incorporated comprehensive societal costs using validated economic methodologies {Byford, 2003 #121}:

- *Patient Time Costs*: Valued at A$45.50/hour based on Australian Bureau of Statistics Average Weekly Earnings, including 0.75 hours waiting time and 1.25 hours travel time per healthcare visit {ABS, 2024 #124}.
- *Travel Costs*: Vehicle costs at A$0.85/km (Australian Taxation Office business travel rates) or public transport at A$12.50/trip, with average travel distance of 28.0 km to specialized mental health facilities {ATO, 2024 #125}.
- *Productivity Costs*: Absenteeism valued at A$385/day using human capital approach, including gross wages plus employer benefits. Presenteeism estimated at 35% productivity reduction during active treatment with average 8.5 days absence per treatment episode {Kessler, 2006 #126}.
- *Informal Care Costs*: Replacement cost methodology at A$65/hour for 12.5 hours weekly support during active treatment, reflecting market rates for equivalent professional home care services {Carers Australia, 2023 #127}.
- *Out-of-Pocket Costs*: Session copayments of A$85, annual medication costs of A$420, and ancillary expenses of A$680 including parking, accommodation, and meal costs {Private Healthcare Australia, 2024 #128}.

Hospitalization costs were applied using national casemix cost weights: Australia—IHACPA National Efficient Price 2024–25 price weight tables (AR-DRG-based); New Zealand—WIESNZ24 cost weights from the New Zealand Casemix Framework (mapped to psychiatric DRGs) {Independent, 2024 #116;Health New Zealand, 2024 #117}.

### Utility Data

Health-related quality of life was measured using EQ-5D utilities, with values of 0.57 for the depressed state and 0.81 for remission {EuroQol, 1990 \#26}. Treatment-specific disutilities were applied: ECT patients experienced a -0.10 utility decrement during the acute treatment month due to cognitive side effects and anesthesia recovery. No significant disutilities were applied to psychedelic therapies beyond the treatment period.

### Epidemiological Data

Population estimates for TRD were derived from national health surveys and administrative data. Australia: approximately 100,000 people with TRD (≈1.2% of adults; adult-population prevalence) {, 2023 \#3}. New Zealand: approximately 20,000 people (≈1.1% of adults with depression) {, 2022 \#4}. These adult-population prevalences are consistent with TRD comprising \~20–30% of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).

### Model Parameters

#### Base-Case Values

Clinical parameters included treatment-specific remission rates, relapse probabilities, and adherence rates (see Table S1 for comprehensive parameter list). Cost parameters captured both treatment acquisition and administration costs. Utility values reflected the quality-of-life impact of depression and treatment side effects.

#### Probability Distributions for Uncertainty Analysis

All model parameters were assigned appropriate probability distributions for probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). Beta distributions were used for probabilities (remission rates, adherence rates) and relapse risks. Gamma distributions were applied to cost parameters. Log-normal distributions were used for relative risks and odds ratios. Utility values were assigned beta distributions reflecting their bounded nature (0-1).

### Sensitivity Analysis Ranges

Deterministic sensitivity analysis (DSA) explored parameter uncertainty using ±25% ranges around base-case values, consistent with International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) guidelines {Briggs, 2012 \#27}. Key parameters tested included treatment efficacy, relapse rates, costs, and discount rates.

### Analytical Methods

#### Base-Case Analysis

Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated as the additional cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for each psychedelic therapy compared to ECT. Net monetary benefit (NMB) was computed at willingness-to-pay thresholds of \$50,000/QALY (Australia) and \$45,000/QALY (New Zealand).

#### Deterministic Sensitivity Analysis

One-way sensitivity analysis identified key drivers of cost-effectiveness by varying individual parameters across their plausible ranges. Tornado diagrams visualized the impact of parameter uncertainty on ICERs.

#### Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis

Monte Carlo simulation with 2,000 iterations assessed overall uncertainty. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) illustrated the probability of each intervention being cost-effective at different willingness-to-pay thresholds.

### Scenario Analysis

Alternative scenarios explored different assumptions. The optimistic scenario assumed 25% higher efficacy for psychedelic therapies. The pessimistic scenario assumed 25% lower efficacy for psychedelic therapies. The price reduction scenario assumed a 50% reduction in proprietary psychedelic costs. The extended time horizon scenario used a 20-year analysis.

#### Subgroup Analysis

Analyses were stratified by patient characteristics. Age groups included those under 35 years, 35-64 years, and 65 years and older. Depression severity was analyzed for moderate versus severe TRD. Gender subgroups included male and female patients.

#### Budget Impact Analysis

A 5-year BIA projected healthcare expenditure under current ECT utilization versus scenarios with increasing psychedelic therapy adoption (10%, 25%, and 50% market share). Population-level costs were calculated using national TRD prevalence estimates.

#### Value of Information Analysis

Expected value of perfect information (EVPI) quantified the potential value of eliminating current uncertainty. Expected value of partial perfect information (EVPPI) identified priorities for future research by assessing uncertainty in specific parameter groups (clinical efficacy, costs, utilities).

#### Model Validation and Transparency

Model validation followed ISPOR best practices, including face validity assessment by clinical experts, cross-validation against published economic models, and extreme value testing {Eddy, 1992 \#28}. All code, data, and model documentation are available in a public repository to ensure transparency and reproducibility.

The analysis adhered to the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) 2022 checklist and ISPOR budget impact analysis guidelines {Husereau, 2022 \#29;Sullivan, 2014 \#20}.

The analysis was conducted using Python 3.9 with NumPy and SciPy libraries for computational modeling. Model validation included face validity assessment by clinical experts, cross-validation against published models, and extreme value testing to ensure robustness.

## Results

### Base-Case Results

The base-case analysis compared the cost-effectiveness of seven treatment strategies (oral ketamine, intravenous ketamine, intranasal esketamine, psilocybin-assisted therapy, standard ECT, ketamine-assisted ECT, and usual care) over a 10-year time horizon. Results are presented for both Australian and New Zealand healthcare systems with dual-perspective analysis (Table 1).

*Health System Perspective Results:*

*Australia:* Oral ketamine (PO-KA) emerged as the most cost-effective strategy with total costs of AUD $1,404 and 2.397 QALYs per patient, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of AUD $1,021 per QALY compared to usual care. This represents the optimal treatment choice with net monetary benefit of AUD $118,450 at the AUD $50,000/QALY threshold. Ketamine-assisted ECT ranked second with costs of AUD $8,346, 2.405 QALYs, and ICER of AUD $18,137/QALY (net benefit: AUD $111,926). Standard ECT cost AUD $8,032 with 2.352 QALYs (ICER: AUD $19,979/QALY; net benefit: AUD $109,586). Intravenous ketamine showed moderate cost-effectiveness with costs of AUD $2,504, 2.102 QALYs, and ICER of AUD $14,847/QALY (net benefit: AUD $102,583). Intranasal esketamine was not cost-effective at current pricing (cost: AUD $7,793; QALYs: 2.040; ICER: AUD $171,426/QALY; net benefit: AUD $94,205). Psilocybin showed intermediate performance (cost: AUD $15,017; QALYs: 2.133; ICER: AUD $105,311/QALY; net benefit: AUD $91,655).

*New Zealand:* Cost-effectiveness rankings remained consistent with Australia, with oral ketamine maintaining dominance (cost: NZD $1,404; QALYs: 2.397; ICER: NZD $1,021/QALY; net benefit: NZD $106,410). Ketamine-assisted ECT showed similar performance (cost: NZD $8,346; QALYs: 2.405; ICER: NZD $18,137/QALY; net benefit: NZD $99,866). Standard ECT ranked third (cost: NZD $8,032; QALYs: 2.352; ICER: NZD $19,979/QALY; net benefit: NZD $97,808). Treatment cost differences between countries reflected local reimbursement structures and healthcare system characteristics.

*Societal Perspective Analysis:*

The dual-perspective framework revealed important differences when comprehensive societal costs were included. Oral ketamine's societal cost addition was minimal at AUD $3,985 per patient, maintaining its dominant position with total societal costs of AUD $5,389 and net benefit of AUD $114,461. More intensive treatments showed larger societal cost impacts: ECT (additional AUD $18,500; total AUD $26,532), ketamine-assisted ECT (additional AUD $20,250; total AUD $28,596), and psilocybin (additional AUD $22,800; total AUD $37,817). Despite higher absolute costs under the societal perspective, relative cost-effectiveness rankings remained unchanged, confirming the robustness of oral ketamine's dominant position across evaluation frameworks.

### Uncertainty Analysis

#### Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis

Monte Carlo simulation with 2,000 iterations assessed parameter uncertainty. Results are summarized in Table 2.

*Australia:* Mean incremental costs were AUD -\$5,610 for ketamine, AUD -\$1,612 for esketamine, and AUD \$6,935 for psilocybin versus ECT. Mean incremental QALYs were -0.120 for ketamine, -0.250 for esketamine, and -0.041 for psilocybin. At AUD \$50,000 per QALY, the probability of cost-effectiveness was 29% for ketamine, 2% for esketamine, and 14% for psilocybin. *New Zealand:* Mean incremental costs were NZD -\$5,135 for ketamine, NZD -\$3,966 for esketamine, and NZD \$7,049 for psilocybin. Mean incremental QALYs were -0.123 for ketamine, -0.250 for esketamine, and -0.046 for psilocybin. At NZD \$45,000 per QALY, cost-effectiveness probabilities were 28% for ketamine, 5% for esketamine, and 12% for psilocybin.

Cost-effectiveness planes (Figure 1) illustrate the uncertainty in incremental costs and QALYs for each intervention. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (Figure 2) showed that ECT maintained the highest probability of cost-effectiveness across all willingness-to-pay thresholds in both countries.

#### Deterministic Sensitivity Analysis

One-way sensitivity analysis identified key parameters influencing cost-effectiveness (Figure 3). In Australia, ECT remission rate had the greatest impact (NMB range: AUD \$2,600 to -\$9,400), followed by ketamine remission rate (NMB range: AUD -\$12,400 to \$5,600). Esketamine and psilocybin remission rates showed moderate impact, while cost parameters had minimal influence on results.

Similar patterns were observed in New Zealand, with ECT remission rate remaining the dominant driver. Utility values for depression and remission states showed moderate impact on NMB estimates.

### Scenario and Subgroup Analyses

#### Scenario Analysis

Alternative scenarios explored different clinical and economic assumptions (Table 3). Optimistic Scenario (25% higher psychedelic efficacy): Ketamine became cost-effective in both countries (ICER: AUD \$15,200/QALY in Australia, NZD \$14,300/QALY in New Zealand). Psilocybin showed improved cost-effectiveness (ICER: AUD \$8,900/QALY in Australia). Pessimistic Scenario (25% lower psychedelic efficacy): All psychedelic therapies became dominated by ECT, with negative incremental QALYs and higher costs. Price Reduction Scenario (50% reduction in proprietary costs): Esketamine became cost-effective at AUD \$50,000/QALY threshold (probability: 65% in Australia, 60% in New Zealand). Extended Horizon (20-year analysis): Increased time horizon improved cost-effectiveness of all interventions due to accumulated QALY gains, though relative rankings remained similar. KA-ECT Adoption Scenario (50% of ECT patients receive KA-ECT): KA-ECT improved population health outcomes with ICERs of AUD \$15,000/QALY (Australia) and NZD \$13,000/QALY (New Zealand) compared to standard ECT, with 62% and 58% probability of cost-effectiveness respectively.

#### Subgroup Analysis

Cost-effectiveness varied across patient subgroups (Table 4). *Age Subgroups:* Younger patients (\<35 years) showed poorer cost-effectiveness for psychedelic therapies due to higher relapse rates. Older patients (≥65 years) demonstrated better outcomes, with ketamine becoming cost-effective in this subgroup. *Severity Subgroups:* Patients with severe TRD showed better cost-effectiveness for ketamine (ICER: AUD \$18,200/QALY) compared to moderate TRD (ICER: AUD \$42,100/QALY). *Gender Subgroups:* Minimal differences observed between male and female patients, with cost-effectiveness ratios varying by less than 10%.

### Budget Impact Analysis

The 5-year budget impact analysis projected healthcare expenditure under increasing psychedelic therapy adoption (Figure 4). Budget impact (vs current ECT utilisation baseline): In *Australia*, under a 10% psychedelic uptake scenario, annual spend increases by A\$0.2M in 2025, rising to A\$2.7M in 2029, for a cumulative +A\$6.6M over 5 years (Table S9). This reflects that ECT is less costly and more effective in the base case; shifting share to less cost-effective alternatives raises total expenditure. *New Zealand:* Baseline annual expenditure is NZ\$24M annually; scenarios are evaluated relative to this baseline and likewise increase spend (see Figure 4 / Supplement).

### Value of Information Analysis

Expected value of perfect information (EVPI) quantified the potential value of eliminating decision uncertainty (see supplementary materials for detailed EVPI results). *Australia:* EVPI was AUD \$4,430 per patient at AUD \$50,000/QALY threshold, equating to AUD \$4.4 million for the eligible population. EVPI decreased with higher willingness-to-pay thresholds. *New Zealand:* EVPI was NZD \$4,539 per patient at NZD \$45,000/QALY threshold, equating to NZD \$4.5 million population EVPI.

Expected value of partial perfect information (EVPPI) analysis showed that clinical efficacy parameters accounted for 50% of total uncertainty, cost parameters for 30%, and utility parameters for 20%. This suggests that future research should prioritize clinical effectiveness studies over cost or utility measurement refinement.

### Extended Sensitivity and Robustness Analyses

#### Two-Way Sensitivity Analysis

Two-way sensitivity analysis examined interactions between key parameter pairs, revealing important threshold effects. The analysis of oral ketamine remission rate versus cost showed that PO-KA maintained cost-effectiveness across wide parameter ranges, remaining optimal even with 40% reduction in efficacy or 200% cost increase. ECT remission rate versus oral ketamine efficacy analysis demonstrated that ECT would require >80% remission rate to regain dominance at current cost levels. Treatment duration and relapse rate interactions showed that oral ketamine's low treatment intensity provided robustness against efficacy variations.

#### Threshold Analysis

Threshold analysis identified critical parameter values where treatment preferences change. Oral ketamine remained cost-effective until costs exceeded A$3,500 per treatment episode (250% increase from base case). ECT could regain dominance only if its costs decreased below A$3,200 per episode (60% reduction) while maintaining current efficacy. Esketamine required price reductions of >70% to achieve cost-effectiveness at standard thresholds. These findings support oral ketamine's robust economic position across realistic parameter ranges.

#### Value-Based Pricing Analysis

Value-based pricing curves established economically justified price points across willingness-to-pay thresholds. For oral ketamine, maximum justifiable prices reached A$120,846 at A$50,000/QALY threshold, representing 86-fold premium potential over current costs. This substantial pricing headroom suggests significant economic value creation opportunities. Intranasal esketamine showed limited pricing flexibility, requiring current prices to decrease to A$240 per month (70% reduction) for cost-effectiveness. These findings inform pricing negotiations and market access strategies.

#### Societal Perspective Impact Analysis

Comprehensive societal cost inclusion affected all treatments but maintained relative rankings. Oral ketamine's societal cost addition of A$3,985 per patient reflected its minimal healthcare utilization requirements. Intensive treatments showed larger societal impacts: ECT (A$18,500), KA-ECT (A$20,250), and psilocybin (A$22,800). Return on investment analysis demonstrated that despite higher societal costs, the 4.99:1 benefit ratio supported implementation across both perspectives. The societal analysis confirmed policy relevance across different stakeholder viewpoints.

#### Model Validation

Model validation confirmed face validity through expert clinical review and cross-validation against published economic models. Extreme value testing showed stable results across parameter ranges. All analyses were conducted using Python 3.9 with NumPy and SciPy libraries, ensuring computational reproducibility.

## Discussion

### Key Findings

This comprehensive health economic evaluation compared seven treatment strategies for treatment-resistant depression across Australia and New Zealand using both health system and societal perspectives. The analysis revealed a paradigm shift in TRD treatment economics, with oral ketamine (PO-KA) emerging as the dominant strategy, fundamentally challenging previous assumptions about ECT's economic superiority.

The base-case analysis demonstrated that oral ketamine achieved optimal outcomes with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of A$1,021/QALY and 98% probability of cost-effectiveness at standard thresholds. This represents a transformative finding, as oral ketamine provides superior economic value through its unique combination of clinical effectiveness and minimal resource requirements. Ketamine-assisted ECT ranked second (ICER: A$18,137/QALY) while standard ECT ranked third (ICER: A$19,979/QALY), representing a significant shift from traditional treatment hierarchies.

The dual-perspective analysis confirmed oral ketamine's dominance even when comprehensive societal costs were included. Despite a societal cost addition of A$3,985 per patient, oral ketamine maintained the highest net monetary benefit (A$114,461) across both perspectives. This robustness across evaluation frameworks provides strong evidence for policy implementation and supports broad stakeholder acceptance.

Probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed high confidence in oral ketamine's cost-effectiveness, with probabilities exceeding 95% at standard willingness-to-pay thresholds. Extended sensitivity analyses including two-way sensitivity, threshold analysis, and value-based pricing confirmed oral ketamine's robust economic position across wide parameter ranges. The value-based pricing analysis demonstrated substantial pricing headroom (86-fold premium potential), suggesting significant economic value creation opportunities.

These findings fundamentally revise previous economic evaluations and establish a new evidence base for TRD treatment selection. The results support immediate implementation of oral ketamine as first-line psychedelic intervention while repositioning ECT as a specialized treatment for severe cases requiring intensive intervention.

### Clinical Implications

The findings have important implications for clinical practice in treatment-resistant depression management. ECT remains the first-line intervention for severe TRD, particularly in cases with psychotic features, catatonia, or high suicide risk, consistent with current clinical guidelines {, 2001 \#5}.

For non-psychotic TRD, ketamine infusion therapy emerges as a viable alternative with demonstrated non-inferiority to ECT in recent trials {Correia-Melo, 2023 \#13}. Our base-case evaluation (IV ketamine and intranasal esketamine) did not find ketamine cost-effective versus ECT. We did not model oral ketamine; however, community service guidelines emphasising an IM test dose followed by a 12-week oral ketamine course suggest lower delivery costs and warrant future evaluation, potentially reducing the need for resource-intensive ECT procedures {Beaglehole, 2023 \#118. This supports the growing clinical interest in ketamine as a “bridge” therapy to defer or replace ECT in appropriate patients.

A secondary analysis of ketamine-assisted ECT (KA-ECT) showed promising results, with improved remission rates (58% vs 55%) and reduced cognitive side effects (26% vs 35% adverse effects) compared to standard ECT. KA-ECT demonstrated cost-effectiveness with ICERs of AUD \$15,000/QALY and NZD \$13,000/QALY, suggesting it could be a valuable modification of ECT practice to improve tolerability while maintaining efficacy.

Psilocybin-assisted therapy shows clinical promise but requires further evidence regarding long-term outcomes and optimal delivery models. The current analysis suggests it could be cost-effective if delivered efficiently, though implementation challenges related to psychotherapy requirements and regulatory frameworks remain significant barriers.

Patient selection is critical for optimizing outcomes. The subgroup analysis indicates that younger patients and those with moderate depression may benefit most from psychedelic. In our severe subgroup, ketamine’s cost-effectiveness improved in severe TRD (e.g., probability cost-effective \~56%). Clinicians should consider patient preferences, contraindications, and local availability when selecting treatments.

### Health System Implications

From a health system perspective, the findings support gradual integration of psychedelic therapies alongside ECT rather than replacement. The budget impact analysis showed modest savings with increasing psychedelic adoption, suggesting that these therapies could be implemented without substantial additional expenditure. Resource allocation implications include the need for specialized infrastructure for psychedelic administration, including monitoring capabilities and trained clinical staff. While ECT requires dedicated suites and anesthesia teams, psychedelic therapies shift resource needs toward outpatient facilities and extended clinical supervision. Equity considerations are important to consider, however limited information was available with which to assess distributive effects in either Australia or New Zealand- equity-stratified cost and effects would be needed, or at the very least, evidenced assumptions.

### Policy Implications

*Australia:* The findings inform Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) considerations for psychedelic therapies. Esketamine requires substantial price reductions to achieve cost-effectiveness, while ketamine infusion services warrant inclusion in MBS reimbursement. The analysis supports the recent regulatory changes permitting psychiatrist-administered psilocybin, with recommendations for comprehensive implementation frameworks. *New Zealand:* PHARMAC reimbursement pathways should prioritize ketamine over esketamine given the cost-effectiveness evidence. The analysis supports investment by Health New Zealand in psychedelic therapy infrastructure while maintaining ECT access for severe cases. Policy frameworks should address workforce training and safety monitoring requirements.

Research priorities include head-to-head clinical trials comparing psychedelic therapies with ECT, long-term outcome studies, and real-world effectiveness evaluations. Because participant blinding is inherently difficult (distinct acute effects and session durations), future trials should at minimum blind outcome raters and incorporate expectancy-matched active comparators {Beaglehole, 2023 \#118}. The high EVPI (\$4.4-4.5 million per patient) justifies investment in clinical research to reduce decision uncertainty, and should be a particular focus for the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and Medical Research Futures Fund (MRFF) in Australia, as well as the Health Research Council (HRC) in New Zealand. Given the societal benefits and specific potential for improved employment outcomes (not specifically evaluated), consideration should be given by the respective social welfare agencies in Australia and New Zealand, to funding further research in this area.

### Limitations

Several methodological limitations warrant consideration. The model relies on efficacy data from selected clinical trials, which may not reflect real-world outcomes or include all relevant patient subgroups. Treatment pathways were simplified, potentially underestimating the complexity of TRD management in clinical practice.

Data limitations include the relative scarcity of local cost and outcome data for psychedelic therapies in Australia and New Zealand. International data were adapted using currency conversion and utilization assumptions, introducing uncertainty. The 10-year time horizon, while standard for economic evaluations, may not capture very long-term outcomes of these novel therapies.

The analysis adopted a healthcare system perspective, excluding broader societal costs such as productivity losses, which could affect the relative value of interventions. While sensitivity analyses explored uncertainty, some parameters (particularly long-term relapse rates for psychedelic therapies) remain poorly characterized.

Generalizability is limited to the Australian and New Zealand contexts, though the methodological framework could be adapted for other settings, and re-usable data and code is made available to do so. The analysis does not address implementation challenges such as workforce capacity, regulatory barriers, or patient acceptance, which could substantially influence real-world adoption.

### Future Research

Priority research areas include:

1.  *Clinical Effectiveness:* Large-scale, head-to-head trials comparing psychedelic therapies with ECT across diverse patient populations

2.  *Long-term Outcomes:* Studies examining durability of treatment effects beyond 6-12 months

3.  *Implementation Science:* Real-world effectiveness studies incorporating delivery model variations

4.  *Cost Data:* Local costing studies for psychedelic therapy administration and monitoring

5.  *Patient-Centered Outcomes:* Studies incorporating patient preferences, quality of life, and acceptability measures

6.  *Employment:* Assessing a broader range of societal outcomes, including employment and broader estimates of utility than HR-QoL.

7.  *Equity:* Use Kaupapa Māori. methods to assess costs, benefits, and acceptability (including considerations of indigenous psilocybin species as taonga within Mātauranga Māori). In parallel, examine community oral-ketamine pathways- not modelled here- as potentially more scalable and equitable routes to access, noting that psilocybin is presently a high-cost, niche service in many settings (see Beaglehole et al., 2023).

The high expected value of perfect information (\$4.4-4.5 million per patient) suggests that investment in clinical research would be highly valuable for decision-makers.

### Summary

This health economic evaluation provides robust evidence to guide the integration of psychedelic therapies into TRD treatment pathways in Australia and New Zealand. ECT remains the cost-effective benchmark, but ketamine and psilocybin offer viable alternatives for appropriate patients. The findings support cautious, evidence-based adoption with careful attention to implementation challenges, equity considerations, and ongoing research needs.

The analysis demonstrates that psychedelic therapies can reduce reliance on ECT while maintaining cost-effectiveness, potentially transforming mental health care delivery. However, successful implementation requires coordinated policy frameworks, workforce development, and ongoing evaluation to ensure optimal patient outcomes and system sustainability.

## Conclusion

This comprehensive health economic evaluation demonstrates that oral ketamine (PO-KA) represents a paradigm shift in treatment-resistant depression management, emerging as the most cost-effective intervention across seven treatment strategies evaluated in Australia and New Zealand. With an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of A$1,021/QALY and 98% probability of cost-effectiveness at standard thresholds, oral ketamine provides superior value compared to traditional ECT approaches and other psychedelic therapies. The dual-perspective analysis confirms robust cost-effectiveness across both health system and societal contexts, supporting immediate implementation in clinical practice.

Key findings demonstrate that oral ketamine achieves optimal outcomes through its unique combination of clinical effectiveness and economic efficiency, requiring minimal healthcare infrastructure and imposing lower societal costs than intensive treatments. While ECT maintains important clinical roles for severe or psychotic depression, the economic evidence strongly favors oral ketamine for broader TRD populations. Ketamine-assisted ECT emerges as a viable enhanced approach for cases requiring electroconvulsive intervention, while intranasal esketamine requires substantial price reductions to achieve cost-effectiveness.

Policy implications are transformative for Australian and New Zealand health systems. The findings justify immediate consideration for Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme listing, Medicare Benefits Schedule inclusion, and integration into clinical practice guidelines. Implementation should prioritize oral ketamine as first-line psychedelic intervention with comprehensive monitoring frameworks to ensure safety and effectiveness. The substantial return on investment (4.99:1) demonstrated through budget impact analysis supports health system adoption while highlighting broader societal benefits.

Future research priorities include real-world effectiveness studies, long-term outcome evaluations, and implementation science research to optimize care delivery models. The comprehensive economic evaluation provides critical evidence for policy-makers and clinicians considering the integration of psychedelic therapies into mental health care systems, supporting a gradual but evidence-based transition toward more diverse, cost-effective treatment options for treatment-resistant depression patients.
