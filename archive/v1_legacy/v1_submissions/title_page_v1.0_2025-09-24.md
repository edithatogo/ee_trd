## Key Points
- **Background**: Treatment-resistant depression poses significant health and economic challenges, with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) as the current standard for severe cases, but emerging psychedelic therapies offer potential alternatives.
- **Findings**: Ketamine shows comparable efficacy to ECT for non-psychotic treatment-resistant depression, while psilocybin demonstrates promising but less established results; health economic analyses suggest context-dependent cost-effectiveness.
- **Implications**: Psychedelic therapies may reduce ECT utilization in appropriate patients, potentially improving access and reducing healthcare costs, but require careful implementation with robust safety protocols.
