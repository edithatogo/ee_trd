Dear Editor-in-Chief,

## Manuscript Submission
I am pleased to submit our manuscript entitled "Cost-Effectiveness of Ketamine, Esketamine, and Psilocybin vs ECT for Treatment-Resistant Depression in Australia and New Zealand" for consideration for publication in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry.

## Manuscript Details
- **Type of Submission**: Original Research Article
- **Word Count**: 6,648 words (excluding abstract, references, tables, and figures)
- **Abstract Word Count**: 225 words
- **Number of Tables**: 4 in manuscript + 6 supplementary
- **Number of Figures**: 4 in manuscript + 10 supplementary
- **Number of References**: 20

## Key Findings
This manuscript presents the first comprehensive cost-effectiveness analysis comparing psychedelic therapies with electroconvulsive therapy for treatment-resistant depression in Australia and New Zealand.

Our key findings include:
- ECT remains the most cost-effective intervention in base-case analysis
- Intravenous ketamine showed ICERs of AUD $28,500/QALY and NZD $26,800/QALY
- Esketamine was not cost-effective at current prices (ICER AUD $156,000/QALY)
- Psilocybin had intermediate cost-effectiveness (ICER AUD $42,300/QALY)
- Probabilistic analysis showed 45% probability of ketamine cost-effectiveness in Australia at $50,000/QALY threshold

## Importance to Field
This work is important because it provides the first comprehensive economic evaluation of psychedelic therapies as alternatives to ECT in Australia and New Zealand, addressing a critical gap in the evidence base for treatment-resistant depression. The findings have direct implications for clinical practice and health policy in both countries, where ECT utilization has declined but psychedelic therapies are emerging as potential alternatives. Our analysis demonstrates that while ECT remains cost-effective, ketamine offers a viable option for non-psychotic TRD cases, supporting gradual integration of psychedelic therapies alongside ECT.

## Originality
To our knowledge, this is the first study to conduct a comprehensive cost-effectiveness analysis comparing intravenous ketamine, intranasal esketamine, and psilocybin-assisted therapy with electroconvulsive therapy in Australia and New Zealand. While previous studies have examined individual psychedelic therapies or conducted analyses in other countries, our study uniquely evaluates all three major psychedelic interventions against ECT using country-specific data, including local costs, reimbursement structures, and willingness-to-pay thresholds ($50,000/QALY for Australia and $45,000/QALY for New Zealand).
