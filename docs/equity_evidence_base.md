## Health Equity Evidence

### Atkinson Epsilon Values
- **ε = 0**: Utilitarian (total health maximization)
- **ε = 0.5-1.0**: Moderate equity concern (standard health economics)
- **ε = 1.5**: High equity priority for Indigenous populations (Māori, Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander)
- **ε = 2.0**: Very high equity priority for rural Indigenous populations
- **ε = 1.0-1.2**: Moderate equity priority for Pacific populations

### Indigenous Health Disparities Evidence

#### Māori Health Inequities (New Zealand)
- Life expectancy gap: 7.3 years lower than non-Māori
- Higher rates of mental health conditions including depression
- Barriers to healthcare access including cultural, geographic, financial
- **Reference**: Ministry of Health. (2019). Hauora: Māori Health Statistics. Wellington: Ministry of Health

#### Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Health Inequities (Australia)  
- Life expectancy gap: 8.6 years lower than non-Indigenous Australians
- Higher rates of psychological distress and mental health conditions
- Significant rural/remote access barriers
- **Reference**: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. (2022). The health and welfare of Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples 2021. Canberra: AIHW

#### Pacific Islander Health Inequities
- Higher rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, mental health conditions
- Language and cultural barriers to healthcare
- Predominantly lower socioeconomic status affecting access

  - Ministry of Health. (2020). Pacific Health Chart Book 2019. Wellington: Ministry of Health
  - AIHW. (2021). Australia's health 2020: Pacific Islander populations. Canberra: AIHW

### Rural/Urban Health Disparities
- Rural populations have reduced access to specialist mental health services
- Higher travel costs and time barriers for treatment
- Limited availability of ECT and novel therapies in rural settings

  - Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. (2020). Rural & remote health. Canberra: AIHW

## Priority Weighting Justification

### Priority Flag = 1 (High Priority)
- Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander peoples (established health inequities)
- Māori (Te Tiriti obligations and documented disparities)  
- Pacific peoples (documented health and access disparities)

### Priority Flag = 0 (Standard Priority)
- Non-Indigenous populations in major cities
- Populations with established healthcare access

This evidence base provides the foundation for realistic and ethically justified equity weights in the V3 DCEA analysis.
